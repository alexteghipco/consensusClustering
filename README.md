# consensusClustering
Package for performing consensus clustering in MATLAB using a number of different unsupervised machine learning methods. Consensus clustering is an ensemble clustering method. You can use this package to cluster subsamples of your dataset many different times, creating a consensus matrix that represents how often each pair of samples was placed in the same cluster. Consensus matrices can be used to evaluate the reliability of a particular clustering approach, find the most reliable clustering solution, and/or fuse different clustering approaches together into a cluster ensemble. This package will help in doing all of the above. 

consensusClustering can create cluster ensembles using: k-means, k-medoids, self-tuning spectral clustering, affinity propagation, and louvain clustering using different distance metrics. consensusSelection computes a number of measures for each consensus matrix, allowing you to evaluate the most reliable clustering solution. First, it implements traditional visual methods for selecting a clustering solution based on consensus using a combination of: consensus histograms, cumulative distribution function curves, and the area under these curves. It also implements an arguably better measure of solution reliability: the Proportion of Ambigously Clustered pairs (PAC). I have found this measure to overfit for large clustering solutions and have additionally developed a way to integrate other statistical measures with PAC to select the optimal solution. These measures include the dip statistic for testing whether a distribution is significantly multimodal, and the bimodality coefficient for measuring the degree to which a distribution is bimodal. This package implements a method for automatically using these measures to select an optimal solution (in optimalConsensus). The key method is constraining the PAC curve to the region of the dip curve that preceeds a clear plateau. A method for selecting a *relatively* optimal solution is then executed. This relies primarily on PAC but uses the bimodality coefficient for additional confirmation. For full description of the method see methods section of 2nd chapter in: Parcellating speech networks using connectivity and multivariate meta-analysis (28863591).

If you are clustering data from different sources, like participants, this package will also help you find group-level solutions. For example, the relatively optimal solutions selected within participants can be adjusted based on the group values. If the solution selected for a participant is unreliable relative to the group, it can be made more reliable by focusing on a less complex solution.

This code and the methods were generated for: Teghipco, A., Kundu, P., Buchsbaum, B., Bandettini, P. & Hickok, G. Functional parcellation of the posterior perisylvian zone. A version of this paper is available in Teghipco, A. (2021). Parcellating speech networks using connectivity and multivariate meta-analysis (28863591). [Doctoral dissertation, University of California, Irvine]. ProQuest. Note, I have tried to make this code more flexible than what was originally used for the paper, but you can call this an "alpha" release. Better documentation and debugging is coming when the paper referenced above is released.
